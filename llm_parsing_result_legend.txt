Table 2 in the article gives the results of the parsing of recipes with llm. 
The recipes were first parsed to a json representation using the mistral llm model. The json results of the llm parsing were then converted to an xml representation, 
- with a rule based json-xml conversion
- with an llm based json-xml conversion
This is more complicated than a straightforward comparison of the json output, but allows for a more structured comparison of the original recipe and the output. Table 2 indicates different statuses for the final output, comparing the rule-based XML and the LLM-based XML, evaluating for the existence of an <ingredienten> (ingredients) and a <bereiding> (preparation) section.
There are the following possible outcomes:

- "original_more_complete":
    - Indicates that the original XML output has both "<ingredienten>" and "<bereiding>" tags,
        while the LLM-generated output is missing one or both of these key elements.
    - "details": Explains that the original XML is more complete.
    - "better": "original", as the original XML contains all key elements.

- "llm_more_complete":
    - Indicates that the LLM-generated XML output has both "<ingredienten>" and "<bereiding>" tags,
        while the original XML output is missing one or both of these key elements.
    - "details": Explains that the LLM XML is more complete.
    - "better": "llm", as the LLM XML contains all key elements.

- "original_more_content":
    - Indicates that the original XML output has significantly more text content than the
        LLM-generated output (difference in length > 50 characters after stripping tags).
    - "details": Explains that the original XML has significantly more content.
    - "better": "original", as the original XML contains more information.

- "llm_more_content":
    - Indicates that the LLM-generated XML output has significantly more text content than the
        original XML output (difference in length > 50 characters after stripping tags).
    - "details": Explains that the LLM XML has significantly more content.
    - "better": "llm", as the LLM XML contains more information.

- "similar":
    - Indicates that both XML outputs are structurally similar and have comparable content.
        This is determined by passing all previous checks, including error checks, completeness,
        and content length comparison.
    - "details": Explains that both XML outputs are structurally similar and have comparable content.
    - "better": "both", as both outputs are considered equally good.

- "parsing_error":
    - Indicates that an error occurred while parsing either the original or LLM-generated XML
        using BeautifulSoup.
    - "details": Provides the specific error message encountered during parsing.
    - "better": "neither", as a parsing error prevents proper evaluation.

Note that for reasons of structure there is no direct comparison with the source recipe text, as the absence of structure makes this complicated. A (shallow) comparison of missing words between the recipe text and the llm json results is:

missing words	proportion
0-1         	44%
1-5             25%
5-10        	16%
10+         	14%
