# Dutch-historical-recipe-trends

This is the repository for the paper *Detecting Changing Culinary Trends Through Historical Recipes* by Gauri Bhagwat, Marieke van Erp, Teresa Paccosi, and Rik Hoekstra (currently under review).

This repository contains a **cleaned corpus** and a series of Jupyter notebooks used to analyze and process historical recipe data. 

**Corpus**

This folder contains all the cookbooks used to extract recipes and ingredients and a csv with newspaper data created in *van Erp, M., Wevers, M., & Huurdeman, H. (2018). Constructing a recipe web from historical newspapers. In The Semantic Web‚ÄìISWC 2018: 17th International Semantic Web Conference, Monterey, CA, USA, October 8‚Äì12, 2018, Proceedings, Part I 17 (pp. 217-232). Springer International Publishing*.

**Code**

The notebooks are structured in a way that allows for step-by-step execution and analysis, starting from the extraction of recipe data to the analysis.
The code is divided in 3 parts and is available in the following files. They are arranged in the order they should be executed:

_Data Preprocessing_

‚öôÔ∏è The first notebooks are respectively used to process and extract recipes (`1_recipe_extraction`) and ingredients (`2_ingredient_extraction.ipynb`) from cookbooks and from newspapers (`3_historical_recipe_web.ipynb`), while `4_relative_frequency.ipynb` is used to calculate the relative frequency of ingredients. 

_Analysis_

üìä The second set of notebooks is used for the analyses we proposed in the paper. `5_ingredient_usage_pattern.ipynb` looks at the most frequently shared ingredients across the different datasets and their evolution in terms of frequency over time. `6_recipe_complexity.ipynb` looks at the recipe complexity according to the average number of ingredients employed, while `7_seasonal_usage_patterns.ipynb` analyses the use of seasonal ingredients in newspaper recipes. 

_Pearson correlation for average frequency over time_ 

üìà In `8_stat_significance_mean.ipynb`, we provide a calculation of the Pearson correlation for ingredients' average frequency and time, as well as visualisations for average distribution, standard deviation and confidence interval.
