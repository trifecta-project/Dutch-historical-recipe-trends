# Dutch-historical-recipe-trends

This is the repository accompanies the paper *Detecting Changing Culinary Trends Through Historical Recipes* by Gauri Bhagwat, Marieke van Erp, Teresa Paccosi, and Rikk Hoekstra (currently under review).

This repository contains a **cleaned corpus** and a series of Jupyter notebooks used to analyze and process historical recipe data. 

_Corpus_

This folder contains all the cookbooks used to extract recipes and ingredients and a csv with newspaper data created in *van Erp, M., Wevers, M., & Huurdeman, H. (2018). Constructing a recipe web from historical newspapers. In The Semantic Web–ISWC 2018: 17th International Semantic Web Conference, Monterey, CA, USA, October 8–12, 2018, Proceedings, Part I 17 (pp. 217-232). Springer International Publishing*.

Code:
The notebooks are structured in a way that allows for step-by-step execution and analysis, starting from the extraction of recipe data to the analysis.
The code is divided in 3 parts and is available in the following files. They are arranged in the order they should be executed:

## Data Preprocessing:
### 1. `1_recipe_extraction.ipynb`

### 2. `2_ingredient_extraction.ipynb`

### 3. `3_historical_recipe_web.ipynb`

### 4. `4_relative_frequency.ipynb`

## Analysis: 
### 5. `5_ingredient_usage_pattern.ipynb`

### 6. `6_recipe_complexity.ipynb`

### 7. `7_seasonal_usage_patterns.ipynb`

## Statistical Testing:

### 8_stat_significance_mean.ipynb
